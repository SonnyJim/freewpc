To compile FreeWPC, follow these general guidelines.  See the
documentation on <http://www.oddchange.com/freewpc> for more details.

1. Decide if you are compiling natively (to run on your machine) or
building a real ROM (to be used in pinmame).

2. Create a file called ".config" in the current directory.
Define at least MACHINE, and optionally NATIVE:

	* Make sure to set "NATIVE=y" if you are compiling in
	native mode.

	* You must define 'MACHINE' to a valid game name.

	* If you are going to run pinmame, set 'TARGET_ROMPATH' to point
	to your mame ROMs directory.

4. Type "make".

5. For a native build, the result should be a program named "freewpc"
in the current directory.  For a ROM build, a .rom file will be
built.  If you defined TARGET_ROMPATH, that ROM will be copied
there as well (replacing any zip file that was already there, which
will get backed up to a .original file; sound ROMs from the original
will also get copied into the new zip archive).
