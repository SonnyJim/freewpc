Trunk pin divertor rule:

Skill Shot
==========

At the beginning of each ball (not counting after balls are locked
or ball saves), the major playfield shots are all lit for a Skill Shot.
Hit any shot right away (without bricking; it will timeout quickly)
to score *two shots* instead of one, as far as "Illusions" scoring
is concerned (see below).

The shots are: Captive Ball, Left Center Loop, Trunk Hole/Wall,
Center Ramp, Right Center Loop (Spinner), Right Ramp, Right Orbit.
There are 2 Trunk modes, only one of which is active at a time
depending on which Trunk face is showing.

In addition, if that particular shot has not been hit previously
for a skill shot, bonus points are also awarded: 200K, 400K, etc.
up to a maximum 1M.

The "Spirit Cards" award, which is collected on the spinner, will
award 2X spins for a maximum of 5 spins before it reverts to single
scoring.

The Award lamps on each shot will flash if a Skill Shot is available
there, or be steady if already collected.


Illusions
=========

Tiger Saw = Captive Ball (3)
Levitating Woman = Center Ramp (3)
Trunk Escape = Trunk Box (3)
Spirit Cards = Spinners (15)
Safe Escape = Center Loops (3)
Metamorphoses = Right Ramp (3)
Strait Jacket = Jet Bumpers (15)
Hat Magic = Trunk Hole (3)

There are two basic objectives:
1. Complete each shot a certain number of times.  For most shots, it
takes 3 hits to "complete it".  For spinners and bumpers, it takes 10x,
or 30.  Progress here carries over from ball to ball.  The goal
increases on every run through all the modes.

2. Complete all of the shots at least once on the same ball.

The grid of Mode lamps (4x2) on the lower playfield tracks your progress
towards objective #1:
	OFF = goal has not been reached
	FLASHING = goal reached on this ball
	ON = goal reached on previous ball

The lamps on each shot track progress towards objective #2.  Lamps
are OFF until they are collected, then they become ON.

The value of a shot is based on the number of times it has been hit
on that ball.  Initial value is 100K, then 125K, up to 25K each time to
a maximum 250K.  For spinners/bumpers, divide by 5. (20K+5K to 50K).
This value resets every ball start.

Reaching the goal on any shot scores 500K, 600K, etc. with no limit.
This bonus resets at the start of each ball.  It also starts Double Scoring;
see below.

Making any 3 different shots in a row (they can be lit/unlit, it doesn't matter)
will award a Combo for the final shot; see Combos below.

When all 8 shots have been completed, Trick Multiball becomes lit at the
Trunk hole.  If all are flashing, because you finished all on the same ball,
you'll get Super Trick Multiball instead.  See below.

When all lamps become solid/flashing, Trunk hole lights for Trick Multiball.
If there are any solid lamps, you can continue to try to complete them again
same ball to flash everything to qualify Super Trick Multiball.

At ball start, any flashing lamps (shots completed previous ball) become solid.
Their counts are also reset, so that you can try to make it flashing again.


Trick Multiball
===============

- Starting this awards the Illusions badge.
- This is initially a 2-ball multiball.  Second ball sent to manual
	plunger before first one is released.
- All shots score maximum.
- Illusion lamps track which shots have been made at least once.
- Complete all 8 shots to light the Right Loop for Super Jackpot,
	worth 2.5M the first time, then 5M, then 7.5M maximum.
- 30 second ballsaver/restart feature in effect: with one ball in play,
	timer begins to count down and you must relock the ball in either
	center loop to return another ball to the plunger.  You can play
	multiball restarts until the timer expires (minimum 5 sec. required).
	During restart, jackpots/Super Jackpot cannot be scored.

- At completion of Trick Multiball, all lamps go OFF and everything is reset.
Goal values are increased (4 per shot, 20 bumpers)
- Getting N shots flashing lights Extra Ball #1 (default N=4).  Once per
	run, reenabled after Trick MB but N++.


Double Scoring
==============

Reaching a shot goal starts a 15 second Double Scoring timer.
This applies to EVERYTHING.

If Double Scoring is already running, and you complete another shot goal,
an additional 15 seconds is awarded.  You can theoretically earn up to
2 min of double scoring time this way.

This timer does not stop for anything like jets, etc.



Combos
======
- Combos earned when 3 or more shots made sequentially.
	- Same shot cannot be made twice in a row.
	- Combo Bonus starts at 250K, up 25K each time to max of 500K.
	- Slingshots/jets cancel the combo timer.
	- 4-way combo scores 2X Combo Bonus.
	- 5-way combo scores 3X.  Cannot collect more than a 5-way.
- Number of combos made is counted across game:
	- Hold Bonus X at 3
	- Light Extra Ball at 6
	- Spot Illusion at 9
	- Light Lock at 12


Theatre:
========
- Shoot Left Loop to add Theatre letters as usual.  This feature is available
	at any time, even during multiballs (?).
- When spelled, ball is diverted to the saucer lock, and then ejected back the
	left loop.  Letters are cleared.
- Trunk Hole is then lit for Theatre Hurry-Up.  Value counts down rapidly from
	1M to 200K in 15 seconds.  Collect it to award the Theatre badge.
- Hurry-Up can be collected more than once during the 15 seconds.  Timer is
	paused briefly during effect and kickout.  Subsequent values are higher:
		1.5X, 2X, 2.5X, 3X at max.  This multiplier carries over between balls?
- Difficulty of Theatre increases for subsequent attempts:
	- Letters no longer carry over from ball to ball.
	- Timer reduced to 10 seconds.
- Once Final Battle played, Theatre difficulty is reset.


Main Multiball:
===============
- Spell MAGIC to light Center Locks.  Shoot Lit Ramps to add letters.
- Shoot Left Ramp Standup to relight Center Ramp.
	Shoot Right Ramp Standup to relight Right Ramp.
- At ball start, both Ramps are lit.  Ramp goes unlit once letter added.
- Lock 2 balls to qualify Multiball at the magnet, shoot magnet to start.
- During multiball, bang away on the trunk to light Jackpot, then shoot
	another shot to collect it:
	- 3 hits (200K) to light Left Ramp for 2M.
	- 4 hits (300K) to light Left Orbit for 4M.
	- 5 hits (400K) to light Right Ramp for 6M.
	- 6 hits (500K) to light Right Orbit for 8M.
	- 7 hits (600K) to light Trunk Hole (wiggling) for 10M.
	- then return to step 1 -- values reset as well.
- Next jackpot level is retained across Multiballs, but progress on level is reset.
- For multiball #3, ramps must be alternated.


Midnight:
=========
- Base time is 12PM.
- Each bumper/right orbit adds time:
	- Bumpers add 10min initially, add 5min per hit each time Captive Ball hit
	on same ball, up to 20 min. per hit.
	- Right orbit advances one hour.
- Right orbit behavior gets progressively harder:
	- For first run, always advances.
	- For second run, advances only on left inlane before shot.
	- For third+ runs, never advances.
- At Midnight, badge is collected and Multiball is lit at the magnet:
	- Immediate score 1.2M.
	- Frenzy mode starts: All switches score 100K
	- Timer = 30 seconds (minimum time played)
	- Right orbit collects Midnight Jackpot = 500K+10K per switch so far.
		Each jackpot also boosts the base value by 250K.  Maximum base is 1.5M.
		Switch addition resets after each collection.
	- Trunk wall increases switch value by 10K, and jackpot boost by 10K.
- Bumpers becomes unlit at ball start and at the end of Midnight Multiball.

- Single ball mode, with 2-ball multiball at the beginning of various stages,
	similar to Cirqus Voltaire.
- Global 2X scoring in effect when 2-balls are in play, but draining 1 ball
	does not end the mode.  Also mode continues across balls.
- Stage 1: Trunk Battle - shoot Trunk wall 30 times.  Each shot is worth 500K.
	After last shot, hole will open to lock ball for effect and completion
	bonus of 2M (total 17M)
- Stage 2: Shoot each Illusion again in order.  Each shot is worth 3M.
	Final shot is Hat Magic to lock ball for effect.  Total 24M.
- Stage 3: Super Spinner - 100 spins needed to win.  But the count will go
	up slowly if you don't make the shot quickly enough.  20K per spin.
	Minimum 20M, likely more.
- Stage 4: Big Multiball!!!
	- Unlimited Balls served for 45 seconds, like World Cup Soccer.
	- All shots score Jackpot Value that increases as each shot is made.
		1M, 1.1M, 1.2M, etc. up to 2.5M per shot.
	- Trunk remains at WALL.
- At completion of Big Multiball, badges are reset and progress can continue
	on other things.
