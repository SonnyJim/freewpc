/**
 * \file
 * \brief An implementation of short, free-running timers.
 *
 * Free timers are similar to the other timer API, but they do not have
 * tasks executing and are therefore more efficient.  The timer is just
 * a counter that is updated at IRQ level.  No action is taken upon
 * expiration, so the only usage is to query a free timer ID to see if
 * it is running.  Free timers are ideal for hardware debouncing such
 * as testing whether or not two switches have been tripped sequentially;
 * the first switch handler would start the timer, and the second will
 * query it.  The implementation is about as simple as can be.
