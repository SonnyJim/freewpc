/**
 * do_firq is the entry point from the FIRQ vector.  This interrupt
 * is generated from the WPC ASIC on two different occasions: (1)
 * when the DMD controller has been programmed to generate an
 * interrupt after drawing a particular scan line, and (2) when the
 * WPC's peripheral timer register reaches zero.  The type of interrupt
 * can be determined by reading the peripheral timer register.
 *
 * The peripheral timer is currently unused.  Real WPC games only used
 * it on the alphanumeric machines, supposedly.  PinMAME doesn't handle
 * it correctly, so the check is kept.
