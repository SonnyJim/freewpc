 * \brief This file implements basic queueing functions.

 *
 * head_off is the index to the next element that can be
 * taken out of the queue.
 *
 * tail_off is the index of the next free position to which
 * a new element can be added.
 *
 * If head_off == tail_off, the queue is empty.
 *
 * Queue full conditions are not checked...
