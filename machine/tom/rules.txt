Spirit Cards = Spinners (15)
Safe Escape = Center Loops (3)
Metamorphoses = Right Ramp (3)

count[n] = # of shots that have been made towards the goal.
	Initialized at game start.
goal[n] = goal, initially as above but increase at higher levels
value[n] = basic scoring value of the next shot.
	Initialized at ball start.	 Increases on each shot made up to a maximum.
	For 3-shots, values are 100K, 125K, 150K, ... up to 250K.

Lamp states:
OFF = goal not collected
FLASING = goal collected same ball
ON = goal collected previous ball
quick pulsing effect = shot just made

Scoring:
- See above for base value.
- The final shot to complete the mode scores 3X.
- Combos earned when 3 or more shots made sequentially.
	- Same shot cannot be made twice in a row.
	- Combo Bonus starts at 250K, up 25K each time to max of 500K.
	- Slingshots/jets cancel the combo timer.
	- 4-way combo scores 2X Combo Bonus.
	- 5-way combo scores 3X.

When a shot is completed:
- Start 15 seconds of 2X scoring.  (Does not stack, but timer will restart.)
- Light goes flashing.
- When all lamps become solid/flashing, Trunk hole lights for Trick Multiball.
If there are any solid lamps, you can continue to try to complete them again
same ball to flash everything to qualify Super Trick Multiball.

At ball start:
- Shot values are reset.
- Flashing lamps (shots completed previous ball) become solid.  Their counts
	are also reset, so that you can try to make it flashing again.

Trunk driver rules (TBD):
- Trunk shows WALL in order to spell THEATRE to light Lock.  When lock is
lit, Trunk shows HOLE.  When Multiball is lit, Trunk shows MAGNET and
scores Trunk Escape hit.  During multiball, Trunk alternates between
HOLE (Jackpot lit) and WALL (unlit).

Trick Multiball:
- Starting this awards the Illusions badge.
- This is initially a 2-ball multiball.  Second ball sent to manual
	plunger before first one is released.
- All shots score maximum.
- Illusion lamps track which shots have been made at least once.
- Complete all 8 shots to light the Right Loop for Super Jackpot,
	worth 2.5M the first time, then 5M, then 7.5M maximum.
- 30 second ballsaver/restart feature in effect: with one ball in play,
	timer begins to count down and you must relock the ball in either
	center loop to return another ball to the plunger.  You can play
	multiball restarts until the timer expires (minimum 5 sec. required).
	During restart, jackpots/Super Jackpot cannot be scored.

- At completion of Trick Multiball, all lamps go OFF and everything is reset.
Goal values are increased (4 per shot, 20 bumpers)


Theatre:
========
- Shoot Left Loop to add Theatre letters as usual.  This feature is available
	at any time, even during multiballs (?).
- When spelled, ball is diverted to the saucer lock, and then ejected back the
	left loop.  Letters are cleared.
- Trunk is then lit for Theatre Hurry-Up.  Value counts down rapidly from
	1M to 200K in 15 seconds.  Collect it to award the Theatre badge.
- Hurry-Up can be collected more than once during the 15 seconds.  Timer is
	paused briefly during effect and kickout.  Subsequent values are higher:
		1.5X, 2X, 2.5X, 3X at max.
- Difficulty of Theatre increases for subsequent attempts:
	- Letters no longer carry over from ball to ball.
	- Timer reduced to 10 seconds.
- Once Final Battle played, Theatre difficulty is reset.


Main Multiball:
===============
- Center white targets needed to qualify Magic Ramps to light Lock


Midnight:
=========

	- Right orbit shot enables Clock advance while ball is in the jet bumpers.
	- Each bumper adds time ala Funhouse.  Base time is 5PM.
		- Unlit adds 10min, lit = 20 min, flashing = 30min.
	- Advance bumpers by shooting the Captive Ball.

Final Battle:
=============
- Once all 4 badges are earned, shoot center loop to begin.
- Single ball mode, with 2-ball multiball at the beginning of various stages,
	similar to Cirqus Voltaire.
- Global 2X scoring in effect when 2-balls are in play, but draining 1 ball
	does not end the mode.  Also mode continues across balls.
- Stage 1: Trunk Battle - shoot Trunk wall 30 times.  Each shot is worth 500K.
	After last shot, hole will open to lock ball for effect and completion
	bonus of 2M (total 17M)
- Stage 2: Shoot each Illusion again in order.  Each shot is worth 3M.
	Final shot is Hat Magic to lock ball for effect.  Total 24M.
- Stage 3: Super Spinner - 100 spins needed to win.  But the count will go
	up slowly if you don't make the shot quickly enough.  20K per spin.
	Minimum 20M, likely more.
- Stage 4: Big Multiball!!!
- At completion of Big Multiball, badges are reset and progress can continue
	on other things.
