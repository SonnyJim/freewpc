/*
 * This program implements a static scheduler based on a periodic interrupt.
 * FreeWPC uses this to generate an IRQ handler that calls the appropriate
 * subroutines that need realtime scheduling.
 *
 * Syntax: sched [options] [input-files]
 * Options:
 * -o <file>       Write the generated C code to <file>.  If not specified,
 *                 stdout is used.
 *
 * -i <include>    Add a #include to the generated code.  This can be
 *                 given multiple times.  The #include lines are just
 *                 inserted at the top of the output.
 *
 * -M <max-ticks>  The maximum amount of unrolling to occur, in ticks. (8)
 *
 * -p <prefix>     The prefix to use on all autogenerated code declarations.
 *                 This could be used if multiple schedules need to be
 *                 compiled into a single program.
 *
 * Each input file is a list of items to be scheduled, generally as follows:
 * <name> <period> <length>
 *
 * where 'name' is the C function name to be invoked, 'period' is how often
 * this task should be called, and 'length' is how long on average it takes
 * this call to run to completion.
 *
 * The period and length are given as the number of periodic interrupts.
 * This is system-dependent; on WPC, 1 interrupt = 976 microseconds.
 * period must be a power of 2.  length can be any value, including a
 * fractional one.  length can also be given in CPU cycles, by appending
 * a 'c' suffix to the value.
 *
 * The scheduler performs a 'load balancing' function based on the duration
 * of each task.  It tries to place tasks into equal-sized buckets, so that
 * on each interrupt, roughly the same amount of CPU is used.
