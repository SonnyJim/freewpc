Announce powerball is next ball out

Coin door message "High power - disabled":
Some TZ's have the wiring for the coil interlock, some don't as it was added
later on in the run

what we do is:

- If coin door is open and we don't know if we have the wiring, 
- Inform the user that we are going to flip the top left flipper and disable buttons
- If the EOS isn't activated, power has not been cut, store that we know the wiring
  isn't present
- Make user adjustable and auto detecting
