/**
 * \file
 * \brief Supports per-player data
 *
 * Some state needs to be "per-player" and not global.
 * We will keep all data 'global' so that access can be fast and easy.
 * We will reserve space for each player so that this data can then be
 * swapped in/out quickly whenever the current player changes.
 *
 * These are termed "local variables" throughout the code.  To declare
 * a local, simply prefix its declaration with "__local__".  The
 * linker will put all locals into a special section of RAM, where
 * these functions expect them.
 *
 * There are also "local flags", which are implemented as a
 * separate bit matrix.
