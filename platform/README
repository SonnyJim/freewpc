The platform directory contains files that are specific to the platform --
the target hardware that is being addressed.

The wpc target is the main focus of FreeWPC at this time.

The whitestar target is not working.

The wpcsound target targets the WPC sound board instead of the CPU board.
It runs but doesn't do much.

The native target is for running on the host build system in simulation.
The simulation acts like the WPC hardware but the I/O is internally executed.
