	; Shadow the middle 30 rows of the display.  For each of
	; these rows, we output the same 16-bit into place, just
	; above it, and just below it.  Since we go from top to
	; bottom, the "just below" case can be set directly, but
	; the other two need to take into account previous iterations,
	; and must use OR instructions.
	; It is relatively fast because we only use 16-bit loads/stores.
	; This gets the shadowing right in the vertical dimension.
	; X and U are already correct set from above.
	;
	; In the first iteration, we get columns right except for the
	; boundary between adjacent 16-bit values.
	; Note also that the source image is not used at all here;
	; we are completely operating on the final image.  We can
	; use X as it already advanced from low to high from the
	; previous instructions.
