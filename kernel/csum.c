/**
 * \file
 * \brief Generic checksum calculation/verification routines.
 *
 * Each module that uses protected memory should declare a structure of
 * type "struct area_csum" that says how that memory should be
 * managed.  Two APIs are exposed per region: one to update the
 * checksum (after the data is changed through proper means), and one
 * to verify the area.  If the checksum does not match, the
 * structure provides a callback function that says how to reset the
 * data to sane values.
