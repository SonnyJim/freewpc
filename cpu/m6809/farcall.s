	;;; Notes:
	;;; 1. The 'A' register is clobbered by the call.  This is OK
	;;; since the ABI only define B and X for return codes.
	;;;
	;;; 2. The 'CC' register is not preserved after the call.
	;;;
	;;; 3. This was changed recently to store the call address in memory
	;;; rather than referencing it from ,U.  This allowed us to free U
	;;; before the call, thereby keeping the total stack space down
	;;; at the cost of an extra store.  (In most cases, this is still a
	;;; win as any sleep done by the target will require saving the stack,
	;;; so keeping this small is a big plus.  The call happens once
	;;; but the task might sleep many times over its lifetime.)
	;;;
	;;; Overhead is about 70 cycles as compared to a normal function
	;;; call, plus 3 extra bytes on the stack.
	;;;
	;;; TODO? - put the saved bank into a global so that the callee can
	;;; get to it, for accessing caller data?
