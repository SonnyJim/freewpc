Inlanes
=======
These can be stepped left and right using the flipper buttons, complete a
rollover for 1M on your score and another 1M on your bonus

Spiralaward
===========
When either left inlane rollover is lit, you have 3 seconds to fire the
ball into the right loop.  If successful you will be randomly awarded one of
the Spiralawards.  You will not be awarded the 'extra ball lit' Spiralaward until
you have collected at least 4 Spiralawards.

Once all Spiralawards have been collected, you are awarded 20M and every
Spiralaward apart from the extra ball is relit.  To retrigger the Spiralaward
once it has been completed once requires you to complete a rollover set.
