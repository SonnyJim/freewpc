/*
 * An implementation of 32-bit long division.  This is optimized for the
 * 6809.  From C code, use the following prototype:
 *
 * void divide32 (const U32 *dividend, U32 *divisor, U32 *quot_remainder);
 *
 * The quot_remainder arg is a pointer to two consecutive U32s; the first will
 * hold the quotient and the second the remainder.  These do not need to be
 * initialized prior to the call.
 *
 * This algorithm could be optimized in a few minor ways but it is kept
 * simple on purpose to minimize code space.  This is already far better than
 * what we were doing before.
