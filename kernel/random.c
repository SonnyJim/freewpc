/**
 * \file
 * \brief This module implements a simple random number generator.
 * This generator does not satisfy the properties required for a really
 * good generator, but is adequate for what pinball machines need.
 *
 * It is a linear congruential generator, derived from the relation
 * Xn+1 = (A(Xn) + C) mod M, where A=33, C=1, and M=255.  This is
 * fairly easy to do with shifts and adds.  This produces a sequence that
 * has a full period, i.e. it won't repeat until all 65536 values have been
 * produced.  The most variance is in the upper 8-bits, so that is all that
 * is returned to the caller.
 *
 * To add an element of true randomness, we will periodically drain 1
 * random number from the sequence according to some external, unpredictable
 * event.  These events do not need to be frequent, but should sufficiently
 * vary.
